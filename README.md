#kOS Utils v1.2

**This boot script is designed to offer some useful utilities to otherwise normal gameplay via the powers of the [Kerbal Operating System mod](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68089). Using it requires absolutely no coding skills whatsoever, however the script itself is well-commented and designed to be an example of how you can use kOS to automate various tasks in Kerbal Space Program.**

##How to install

1. Download and install kOS ([CKAN](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067) is great for this!)
2. Download the kOS Utilities Script and place it in your [KSP install location]/Ships/Script folder (kOS will create this folder, however if you haven't run KSP with kOS installed, you may create it yourself).
3. Attach a kOS CPU to your craft of choice
4. In the tweakable menu for the CPU, select *boot_kos_utils* as the boot script
5. Launch your ship and follow the instructions!

##Utilities included

* Panel Util - Opens and closes your ship's solar panels based on whether you're in atmosphere or not. This prevents you from forgetting to open them and running out of power, or forgetting to close them and breaking them off in flight. Also opens the panels if the ship is landed and stationary.
* Gear Util - Raises and lowers your ship's landing gear and/or landing legs based on how high you are off the ground. 100m is the default setting, although that can be changed in the script if you so desire.
* Chute Util - Automatically deploys your ship's parachutes if you're descending below 10km and the chutes show as 'Safe To Deploy' in the right-click menu. Best used for capsules returning from orbit.
* RT Antenna Util - Automatically deploys any extendable RemoteTech antennas once you leave the atmosphere and retracts them when you re-enter. This prevents you from forgetting to open your antennas and losing contact with your probe. Also opens the antennas if the ship is landed and stationary. Will continue to function even if there's no RT connection!
* Fairing Util - Automatically jettisons all fairings on the vessel when you reach 95% of the current body's atmosphere height. This utility will automatically disable itself once it is fired. Compatible with stock, KW, and procedural fairings.
* LES Util - Automatically jettisons the stock Launch Escape Tower when exiting the atmosphere or three seconds after a manual abort. This utility automatically disables itself once it is fired.
* Autobrake Util - Automatically activates the wheel brakes on landing and releases them during takeoff.
* Engine Vector Util - Keeps engines that are tagged correctly and mounted directly to an IR hinge pointed at the ship's center-of-mass. Great for off-axis designs like the Space Shuttle!
* Low Power Shutdown (always-on) - Automatically shuts down the kOS core if the ship's electric charge is below 10% and still falling.

I also left room in the menu for one more utility for you to write! You can use the current utilities as an example of how to write one. Be sure to consult the [kOS documentation](http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/) and feel free to ask questions in the [/r/kOS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kos) subreddit.

If you write a utility that you feel should be included with this release, I'll happily entertain a pull request!

*****

**Special Instructions:**
* Engine Vector Util - Please use the kOS part tag field to tag any engines you would like to utilize this util on as "Vector Engine". The engine must be mounted directly to an IR hinge. If the hinge rotates all the way to the stop when you activate the util, ensure the hinge is set up to rotate far enough to point at the center of mass. If it should, try inverting the hinge's movement in its right-click-menu or via the IR menu.
